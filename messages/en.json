At its heart stands the snow-capped Khüiten Uul, the highest peak in Mongolia at 4,374 meters (14,201 ft), and the tallest of the five sacred peaks that give the Tavan Bogd Mountains—literally “Five Saints”—their name. The national park spans 630,000 hectares and is home to three large freshwater lakes, 34 glaciers, and several waterfalls. The largest glacier, Potanin, covers 23 km². The Tavan Bogd Mountains hold deep spiritual significance for local Kazakh, Tuvan, and Mongolian communities. The park stretches along the Russian and Chinese borders, following the Altai Mountain Range where Mongolia, Russia, China, and Kazakhstan meet. Rich in history, the region features tens of thousands of ancient petroglyphs, now part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with Turkic stone statues and burial mounds—evidence of the many ancient tribes who once held ceremonies here. The best time to visit is from June to October, when the weather is milder and tour camps are active. August and September are particularly popular for mountain climbing and coincide with eagle festivals, drawing visitors who combine cultural experiences with nature travel. Winter brings its own adventures, including snow skiing and traditional eagle hunting. Whether you're interested in day hikes, horseback riding, or camping under starry skies, Altai Tavan Bogd offers unforgettable experiences year-round.",
